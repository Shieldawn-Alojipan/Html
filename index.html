<p align="justify"> <b> Jozu is a big, muscular, heavily-armored and dark-skinned man. The dark armor he wears and his hair style are very similar to that of an Aztec warrior, with red-bolted darl shoulder pads. The front and back portions of his armor are connected by a metal strap that goes over both his collarbones. Jozu has a long face with stripe-like patterns for a beard and hairstyle. His legs are relatively thin, in comparison to his muscular arms. He appears battle-hardened and has a perpetual scowl on his face. is a gruff, fairly quiet individual who tends to point out info to his crewmates. He appears to be quite unrelenting to his enemies as he had no qualms in attempting to strike an almost-downed Crocodile a second time immediately after a first hit. Like the other commanders, he is loyal to Whitebeard and his crew.As the commander of the third division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. He was one of the few men unaffected by the powerful Haki released by the Yonkou Shanks. He is very experienced and a veteran of the Whitebeard pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger. He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as the third division commander. During the Marineford war, Jozu was powerful enough to fight almost equally against the Shichibukai and the Marine Admirals..</b></p><b>

As the right-hand man to Whitebeard himself, Vista's unwavering loyalty and exceptional swordsmanship make him a force to be reckoned with in the treacherous seas of the Grand Line.One of the defining traits of Vista is his unyielding loyalty to Whitebeard, the captain of the Whitebeard Pirates.

<p align="justify"> <b>The Whitebeard Pirates were once one of the strongest pirate crews in the world, as their late captain, Edward Newgate, better known as "Whitebeard", was one of the Four Emperors and the only man to have ever been a match for the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, in a fight.[3] Whitebeard's crew was segmented into divisions, with each led by a powerful division commander. The crew also had multiple subordinate crews operating in the New World, allowing the pirate crew to function as a massive pirate fleet. In addition, they controlled several territories throughout the New World, including Fish-Man Island.Two years before the current storyline, the Whitebeard Pirates and many of their subordinate crews engaged Marine Headquarters in the legendary Summit War of Marineford over the fate of the crew's second division commander, Portgas D. Ace. Unfortunately, both Ace and Whitebeard met their untimely ends; the latter having been murdered by the Blackbeard Pirates led by Marshall D. Teach aka "Blackbeard", who had betrayed the crew earlier on. Following this, the Whitebeard Pirates lost much of their power and influence in the New World, and many of their former territories were conquered by Blackbeard. A year later, the remaining members of the crew, led by first division commander Marco "the Phoenix", engaged the Blackbeard Pirates' full forces in the Payback War, which ended with their brutal defeat, thus leading to them disbanding and Blackbeard becoming Whitebeard's replacement within the Four Emperors.. </b></p><b
